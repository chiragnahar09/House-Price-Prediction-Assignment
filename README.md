## Regression model for House Price Prediction
> This project is to build a linear regression model for the prediction of house Prices in Australia.


## Description of the Project
A US-based housing company named Surprise Housing has decided to enter the Australian market. The company uses data analytics to purchase houses at a price below their actual values and flip them on at a higher price. For the same purpose, the company has collected a data set from the sale of houses in Australia. The data is provided in the CSV file below.
The company is looking at prospective properties to buy to enter the market. You are required to build a regression model using regularisation in order to predict the actual value of the prospective properties and decide whether to invest in them or not.
The company wants to know:
1. Which variables are significant in predicting the price of a house, and
2. How well those variables describe the price of a house.

Also, determine the optimal value of lambda for ridge and lasso regression.
In this Project, we will use EDA and Linear Regression to understand which variables can be used to explain the house Prices.

For the above objective we have a day dataset and a data dictionary

## We have performed below steps for this project.
1. Data understanding
2. Data Cleaning (Missing values treatment, outlier treatment etc)
3. Univariate analysis
4. Bivariate analysis
5. Splitting the data in train-test
6. Rescaling the features
7. Create the model using Ridge and Lasso
11. Evaluate the model by running it on test data
12. Calculate the R2 on the test data
